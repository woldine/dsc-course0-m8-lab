# Aviation Accident Analysis (1948-2023)

# Objective

This lab analyzes commercial and passenger aircraft accident data from (1983–2023) to identify:
- Aircraft makes/models with fatal/serious injury rates.
- Planes with destruction rates.
- How weather conditions and engine types impact crash severity.

The goal is to provide insights and recommendations for an aviation insurer, with separate guidance for small (under 20 passengers) and large (20+ passengers) aircraft.

The results show that: 

# Small Aircraft Category (Under 20 Passengers)
        # Safest Makes:
- Cessna
- Piper
- Beechcraft
- Mooney
- Champion

# Large Aircraft Category (20+ Passengers)
    # Safest Makes:
- Boeing
- Airbus
- McDonnell Douglas
- Embraer
These models showed very low injury and destruction rates.
